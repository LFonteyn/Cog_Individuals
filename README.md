## Abstract
This study investigates the extent to which there is individuality in
how structural variation is conditioned over time. Earlier research already classified
the diachronically unstable gerund variation as involving a high fraction
of mixed-usage speakers throughout the change, whereby the proportion of the
conservative variant versus the progressive variant as observable in the linguistic
output of individual language users superficially resembles the mean proportion
as observable at the population level. However, this study sets out to
show that there can still be heterogeneity within such a centralized population
in terms of how each individual conditions the observed variation. A random
forest and conditional inference tree analysis of over 14,000 gerunds uttered by
nineteen seventeenth-century authors is presented to show that, while the most
important language-internal factors conditioning the gerund variation are
adopted by (and shared between) all authors, we can still attest inter-individual
variation (i) at lower levels of variable importance, and (ii) in the breadth of the
range of contexts individual authors employ to condition the attested variation.
